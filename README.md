# World-Bank-funding
This project use data from the World Bank to inspect project spending. We will try to understand how World Bank distributed its money among different regions of the world.

The World Bank has a set of APIs that allow anyone to download and use data describing how they invest
in projects around the world. The data can be downloaded in a JSON format. 

You can download the data using this link:

The smaller data set (world_bank_projects.json) used in this project was uploaded together with the python code.
